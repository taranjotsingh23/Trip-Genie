The name of this project is TRIP GENIE. This project is made using nodejs and puppeteer(Webscrapping and Automation).
I have given it name TRIP GENIE because the user just need to provide choice, basic details and after running the script, the user will get the desired information in well maintained .json files along with the screenshots of the webpages.
If the user enters choice:1 and then runs the script, Automation of https://www.makemytrip.com website will be carried out and the user will get information regarding Flight Tickets Booking in .json file and will also get a screenshot of the information.
Similarly, If the user enters choice:2 and then runs the script, Automation of https://www.makemytrip.com website will be carried out and the user will get information regarding Train Tickets Booking in .json file and will also get a screenshot of the information.
Similarly, If the user enters choice:3 and then runs the script, Automation of https://www.makemytrip.com website will be carried out and the user will get information regarding Bus Tickets Booking in .json file and will also get a screenshot of the information.
