The name of this project is TRIP GENIE. This project is made using nodejs and Puppeteer(WebScrapping and Automation).
I have given it name TRIP GENIE because the user just need to provide Choice, Basic Details and after running the Script, the user will get the desired Information in well maintained .json files along with the Screenshots of the Webpages.

It performs Automation and Web Scrapping of https://www.makemytrip.com website and performs the following operations:

1) For Choice:1 -> It provides Flight Tickets Booking Information in .json file and Screenshot of the Information in the screenshots directory.
2) For Choice:2 -> It provides Train Tickets Booking Information in .json file and Screenshot of the Information in the screenshots directory.
3) For Choice:3 -> It provides Bus Tickets Booking Information in .json file and Screenshot of the Information in the screenshots directory.
4) For Choice:4 -> It provides Hotel Booking Information in .json file and Screenshot of the Information in the screenshots directory.
5) For Choice:5 -> It provides Holiday Packages Booking Information in .json file and Screenshot of the Information in the screenshots directory.
6) For Choice:6 -> It provides Tourist Places to visit in India(State-Wise) Screenshot in the screenshots directory.

Basically, I have added Choices in this Project to make it more Efficient and User-friendly so that the user can get the desired Information and Screenshots in very less time just by entering the Choice hence, this project has 6 Features in it as mentioned above.
