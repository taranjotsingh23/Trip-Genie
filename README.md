# hackathonProject
The name of this project is TRIP GENIE. This project is made using nodejs and Puppeteer(WebScrapping and Automation).
I have given it name TRIP GENIE because the user just need to provide Choice, Basic Details and after running the Script, the user will get the desired Information in well maintained .json files along with the Screenshots of the Webpages.

It performs Automation and Web Scrapping of makemytrip.com Website and performs the following operations:

1) For Choice:1 -> Flight Tickets Booking Information in .json file and Screenshot in screenshots directory.
2) For Choice:2 -> Train Tickets Booking Information in .json file and Screenshot in screenshots directory.
3) For Choice:3 -> Bus Tickets Booking Information in .json file and Screenshot in screenshots directory.
4) For Choice:4 -> Hotel Booking Information in .json file and Screenshot in screenshots directory.
5) For Choice:5 -> Holiday Packages Booking Information in .json file and Screenshot in screenshots directory.
6) For Choice:6 -> Tourist Places to visit in India(State-Wise) Screenshot in screenshots directory.

Basically, i have added Choices in this Project to make it more Efficient and User-friendly so that the user can get the desired Information and Screenshots in very less time just by entering the Choice hence, this project has 6 Features in it as mentioned above.
